# The Supluwu

A voltage converter for 3D printers.

## Motivation

When modifying a 3D printer, sometimes you need smaller Voltages to run for example a Raspberry PI or 12V Fans. Smaller buck converter modules are useful but can be hard to mount or connect multiple devices to. The Supluwu is a small board meant to fix this.

## Features

The Supluwu features 2 Voltage rails with 5V and 12V. Each Voltage Rail is capable of 5A and is spread out over 3 Terminals. The Input of each Rail is Fused with a 20mmx5mm glass fuse. The Input Voltage can be anything from 14-30V, so the typical 24V power supply of a 3D printer works fine. Each Terminal has a indicator LED, that lights up, if the buck converter is working properly.

## Heat Management

Heat Produced by the Regulator is spread out to the PCB and can be carried away by the PCB mounted [14mmx14mm heat sinks](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B09DKJPZRX?th=1).
